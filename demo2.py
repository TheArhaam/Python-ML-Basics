# Sequential: That defines a SEQUENCE of layers in the neural network
# Flatten: Our images are squares, Flatten just takes those squares and turns them into a 1 dimensional set.
# Dense: Adds a layer of neurons
# Each layer of neurons need an activation function to tell them what to do
# Relu effectively means "If X>0 return X, else return 0" -- so only Positive values are returned
# Softmax takes a set of values, and effectively picks the biggest one
# Input image size is 28x28
# 128 is the number of function
# 10 means the output will be between 1-10
